Method description:
I first add more features comparing to hw3 to train a XGBoost Regression model, and tune the parameters to get the best model with RMSE on validation set equals to 0.978.
I also tried to train a CF model based on matrix completion and ALS, but the performance does not become better.
I then tried weighted hybrid, switching hybrid, and Meta-Level hybrid, but the performance is still not better than XGBoost Regression model. Therefore, I finally used the XGBoost Regression model.

Error Distribution:
>=0 and <1: 102340
>=1 and <2: 32773
>=2 and <3: 6122
>=3 and <4: 806
>=4: 3

RMSE:
0.9778950293422132
